/*
the minimum number of functions present in c++
1. 0
2. 1
3. 2
4. infinite

ans: 1

The minimum number of functions in a C++ program is one, which is the main() function.

This is because:
	•	The main() function is mandatory in every C++ program, as it serves as the entry point of execution.
	•	A C++ program cannot run without the main() function.
